# RecommendationSys

Recommendation systems are a type of ML algorithm that provides user with relevant recommendations. When we search for something anywhere, be it in an app or in our search engine, the recommendation system is used to provide us with relevant results. They use a class of ML algorithms to find out the relevant recommendation for the user. In this project, I will discuss two types of recommendation system namely:

###  Content Based Recommendation System 

Content-based Filtering is a ML-technique that uses similarities in features to make decisions. It is often used in recommendation systems, which are algorithms designed to advertise or recommend things to users based on knowledge accumulated about the user. For example, it is only capable of suggesting a movie which are close to a certain movie.
Also, the system that is not really personal. It doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone asking the system for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of the gender or person.


###  Collaborative Recommendation System 

Collaborative filtering needs a set of items that are based on the userâ€™s historical choices. This system does not require a good amount of product features to work. An embedding or feature vector describes each item and user, and it sinks both the items and the users in a similar embedding location. It creates enclosures for items and users on its own.
